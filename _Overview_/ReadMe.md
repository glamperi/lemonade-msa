# Overview

This is a group of projects which demonstrate a very small
system made of microservices. The system is trivial and the
microservices are few in number. The point is to demonstrate
the processes and toolsets for DevOps without getting wrapped
up in a complex system. 

# Getting Hands On

The code and steps for code wrangling are found in the
`GettingStarted.md` document

# The System

The Lemonade Demo is a set of microservices which "serve" 
virtual servings of lemonade or other beverages. The servings
are really just JSON messages passed back to a front end
(which is optional, for simplicity).
